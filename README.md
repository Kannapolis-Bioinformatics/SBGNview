# SBGNview
SBGNview is a tool set for visualizing omics data on SBGN pathway maps.  Given omics data and a SBGN-ML file with layout information, SBGNview can display omics data as colors on glyphs and output image files. SBGNview provides extensive options to control glyph and edge features  (e.g. color, line width etc.). To facilitate pathway based analysis, SBGNview also provides functions to extract glyph information and pairwise interactions from SBGN-ML files. SBGNview can map a large collection of gene, protein and compound ID typs to glyphs.  


# Introduction
Molecular pathways have been widely used in omics data analysis. We previously developed an R/BioConductor package called Pathview, which maps, integrates and visualizes omics data onto KEGG pathway graphs. Since its publication, Pathview has been widely used in numerous omics studies and analysis tools. Here we introduce the SBGNview package, which adopts Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN)[@le2009systems] and greatly extends the Pathview project by supportting multiple major pathway databases besides KEGG.

Key features:

* Pathway diagram is drawn with SBGN notations 

* Supports major pathway databases and user defined pathways. 

* Extensive choices for graphical control. 

* Pathway related data extraction and analysis

# Installation

## Prerequisites
*SBGNview* depends on the following packages:

* *xml2*: parse SBGN-ML files
* *rsvg*: convert svg files to other formats (pdf, png, ps). librsvg2 is needed to install rsvg. See this page for more details: https://github.com/jeroen/rsvg
* *pathview*: map between different ID types for gene and chemical compound.
* *igraph*: find shortest paths

## Install SBGNview
```{r setup, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)){
     install.packages("BiocManager")
}
BiocManager::install( c("pathview", "xml2", "igraph", "rsvg"))
```
Install **SBGNview** itself through Bioconductor 
```{r install, eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install(c("SBGNview"))
```

Install **SBGNview** through GitHub:
```{r install.1, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("datapplab/SBGNview")
```
Clone the Git repository:
```{r clone.git, eval = FALSE}
git clone  https://github.com/datapplab/SBGNview.git
```


## Quick example
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# load demo dataset and pathway information of built-in collection of SBGN-ML files
library(SBGNview)
data("gse16873.d","pathways.info")
input.pathways <- find.pathways("Adrenaline and noradrenaline biosynthesis")
SBGNview.obj <- SBGNview(
          gene.data = gse16873.d[,1:3], 
          gene.id.type = "entrez",
          input.sbgn = input.pathways$pathway.id,
          output.file = "quick.start", 
          output.formats =  c("png")
          ) 
print(SBGNview.obj)
```
Two image files (a .svg file and a .pdf file) will be created in the current working directory.
